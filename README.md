# insta-logger

This is a selenium based bot that logs instagram direct messages. currently the bot is very limited (some things are hard coded) because I am still figuring things out. A graphical user interface (GUI) built using the `tkinter` library is planned, however, no effort has been put towards it yet.

# How to use

currently you will need to rename `default_login.json` to `login.json` then replace the fields with required info. For `private` add `Yes` if you are logging a 1 to 1 direct message, however if you are logging a group chat then add `No`. You can use true or false instead if you desire.
